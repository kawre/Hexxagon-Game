# Hexxagon Game
In this project, I developed a Hexxagon game using C++ programming language and the SFML framework. Hexxagon is a strategic board game that involves moving and capturing hexagonal pieces on a grid. The objective of the game is to gain the highest score by strategically capturing as many opponent's pieces as possible.
# Requirements
To get started with the project, it is important to have SFML installed in the C:/SFML/ directory.
